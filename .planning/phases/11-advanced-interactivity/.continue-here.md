<current_state>
All 11 phases complete (45/45 plans). Milestone audit has been run and the report is at `.planning/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`. GSD was updated from v1.18.0 to v1.20.0 this session. The audit report is uncommitted.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 11 Plan 11-04: Testing + visual verification — 3 rounds of iterative bug fixes for zoom, brush, and hover interactions. All 5 visual scenarios approved by user.
- Milestone audit: Created v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md with status "tech_debt"
  - 6/7 requirements satisfied (date/time scales missing)
  - 11/11 phases complete (6 formally verified, 5 with SUMMARY evidence)
  - 6/6 integration checks passed
  - 6/6 E2E user flows complete
  - 10 tech debt items across 7 categories
- GSD update: v1.18.0 → v1.20.0
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Commit the milestone audit report (.planning/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md)
- Decide next step: complete milestone (accept tech debt) OR plan gap closure (date/time scales, missing verifications)
- If completing: run /gsd:complete-milestone v1.0
- If addressing gaps: run /gsd:plan-milestone-gaps
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Milestone audit status: tech_debt (not passed, not gaps_found) — all core functionality works, one partial requirement (date/time scales), accumulated maintenance debt
- Zoom clears brush selection: intentional design decision (brush rectangle becomes stale after zoom reposition)
- Pixel-position highlighting for brush: check SVG element attributes instead of inverting to data domain (fixes categorical scale issues)
- Hover respects brush state: skip hover dimming when data-brush-active attribute is set on panel
- Zoom filter: wheel zoom from anywhere, drag-pan only from background rect (prevents tooltip/click conflicts)
</decisions_made>

<context>
The gg2d3 package is feature-complete for its v1.0 milestone. All 11 phases delivered: foundation refactoring, scales, coordinates, essential geoms, statistical geoms, layout engine, legends, basic faceting, advanced faceting, interactivity foundation, and advanced interactivity. 487+ tests pass. The main question now is whether to ship v1.0 accepting the tech debt (monolithic as_d3_ir.R, missing date/time scales, missing formal verifications for early phases) or to address gaps first.

Start with: Decide whether to /gsd:complete-milestone v1.0 (accept debt) or /gsd:plan-milestone-gaps (address gaps). Then commit the audit report.
