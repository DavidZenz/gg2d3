<details>
<summary>✅ v1.9 sf Robustness and Expansion (Phases 36-39) — SHIPPED 2026-05-22</summary>

See `.planning/milestones/v1.9-ROADMAP.md` and `.planning/milestones/v1.9-REQUIREMENTS.md` for full details.

Delivered automated browser sf smoke harnessing, point-family and line-family `geom_sf()` IR/rendering/interactivity, hardened sf facet/documentation coverage, and package internals hardening around sf helper boundaries, ggplot2 compatibility wrappers, and regression gates.

Known deferred items at close: no open GSD artifacts. No formal `v1.9-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` was present; closeout relied on clear open-artifact audit plus phase verification and code review artifacts.

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.8 Production geom_sf Polygon MVP (Phases 32-35) — SHIPPED 2026-05-20</summary>

See `.planning/milestones/v1.8-ROADMAP.md` for full details.

Delivered production-safe polygon-family `geom_sf()` support: R-side sf extraction, WGS84 normalization, skipped-row diagnostics, D3 `path.geom-sf` rendering, tooltip/hover/handler interactivity, centroid brushing, sf zoom suppression, shared stacked-layer projection, faceted panel projection, and documentation/browser validation hardening.

Known deferred item at close: a future DOM-level browser smoke test would further reduce regression risk for rendered sf paths and brush behavior. See `.planning/milestones/v1.8-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`.

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.7 Choropleth Map Research (Phases 27-30) — SHIPPED 2026-05-20</summary>

See `.planning/milestones/v1.7-ROADMAP.md` for full details.

Delivered the `geom_sf` research handoff: R extraction feasibility, D3 polygon rendering prototype, interactivity design, and future implementation blueprint.

</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Distribution: pkgdown and GH Pages Publishing (Phase 31) — SHIPPED 2026-05-17</summary>

Phase 31 was orthogonal to the v1.7 choropleth stream. It ported the pkgdown/GitHub Pages publishing work from the v1.1 `stupefied-austin` branch.

See `.planning/milestones/v1.7-ROADMAP.md` and phase history for distribution details.

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.0-v1.6 Previous Milestones — SHIPPED 2026-02-16 to 2026-04-04</summary>

See `.planning/milestones/` and archived roadmap files for full details on the MVP, interactive exploration, transitions, facets, theme parity, non-Cartesian systems, and advanced geom milestones.
